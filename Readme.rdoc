=ShadowFacter

ShadowFacter is a Ruby DSL for Facter, extracted out of the work we at Rails
 Machine are doing on Moonshine[http://blog.railsmachine.com/articles/2009/01/16/moonshine-configuration-management-and-deployment/].

 ShadowFacter provides a DSL for creating facts and processing them using Facter.
 For documentation on writing these manifests, please see
 ShadowFacter::Base.

A binary[link:files/bin/shadow_facter.html] is provided to parse facts.
