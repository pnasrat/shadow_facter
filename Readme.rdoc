= ShadowFacter

ShadowFacter is a Ruby DSL for Facter, extracted out of the work we at Rails
Machine are doing on Moonshine[http://blog.railsmachine.com/articles/2009/01/16/moonshine-configuration-management-and-deployment/].

ShadowFacter provides a DSL for creating facts and processing them using Facter.
For documentation on writing facts, please see
{ShadowFacter}[http://railsmachine.github.com/shadow_facter/files/lib/shadow_facter/base_rb.html].

A binary[http://railsmachine.github.com/shadow_facter/files/bin/shadow_facter.html] is provided to parse facts.
